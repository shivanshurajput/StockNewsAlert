# StockNewsAlert
I created a Python application that provides stock news alerts. The idea behind the application is to notify users of any significant changes in stock prices as well as relevant news related to the stock.

To achieve this, I designed the application to keep track of stock prices and calculate the difference between the current day's price and the previous day's price. If the difference is significant, the user is immediately notified.

In addition to tracking stock prices, the application also fetches relevant news articles from credible sources. This ensures that users are always up-to-date on the latest news that may affect the stock prices.

Overall, I believe that this application is an effective tool for investors and traders who want to stay informed about the latest changes in stock prices and news. It was satisfying to create an application that can provide value to others in the world of finance.
